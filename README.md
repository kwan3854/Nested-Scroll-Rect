# Nested Scroll Rect (AdvancedScrollRect)

## Overview

![sample](Documentation/sample.gif)

Nested Scroll Rect is a utility that allows you to easily nest multiple `ScrollRect` components within each other (e.g., a vertical scroll containing horizontal scrolls) and correctly forward drag events either to the child or to the parent `ScrollRect`, depending on the drag direction.

When a parent `ScrollRect` and a child `ScrollRect` are both present, a typical issue is that the child intercepts all drag events, preventing the parent from scrolling if the user drags in the parentâ€™s scroll direction. Nested Scroll Rect solves this by forwarding drag events to the parent when appropriate.

## Repository & Sample

This repository contains a sample project. To try it out:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Unity project in the folder.
3. Look for the sample scenes to see how nested scrolls work.

## Usage

### 1. Setting up in the Editor

1. Create a parent `ScrollRect` (for example, a vertical scroll) in your scene.
2. Under that parent, create a child `ScrollRect` and add the `NestedScrollRect` component (for example, a horizontal scroll).
3. In the Inspector of your `NestedScrollRect`, assign the parent `ScrollRect`to the Parent Scroll Rect field.
   - Alternatively, click the button to automatically find the nearest parent `ScrollRect`.

### 2. Dynamic / Runtime Instantiation

If you instantiate the child `NestedScrollRect` at runtime under a parent `ScrollRect`, it will automatically find and assign the closest parent scroll rect.

- This saves you from having to manually specify the parent.
- However, note that searching for the parent does have a small performance overhead.
